# Superset Taxonomy

This document defines how supersets are classified and selected
within TrainIQ2.

Supersets are not treated as arbitrary pairings.
They are categorized based on:
- Training intent
- Equipment friction
- Station compatibility
- Real-world gym constraints

---

## Superset Philosophy

Supersets should:
- Increase training density
- Reduce idle time
- Avoid unnecessary setup
- Be executable in busy commercial gyms
